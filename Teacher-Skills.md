Computer Skills for Teachers
=======================

### *Note for head teachers/administrators:*
Here is a detailed list of the computer skills your teachers need to know. The skills are organized into levels and the levels are ordered by importance. 

Each skill is written as a concrete task so that teachers can demonstrate when they've mastered each skill. To keep a record of which skills have been mastered, you can print this list and check off (or initial) next to each skill after the teacher has shown you s/he can correctly complete the task listed. 

The skills listed here can be applied to most school technology setups, including those with limited or no Internet access, BUT before using with teachers, you should review this list and modify for your school's technology setup.
